        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jedidiah Owusu-Ansah Manu, and I am an aspiring web developer, cybersecurity enthusiast, software engineer, and data scientist.
            I have a passion for technology and a strong desire to create innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on the world.
            I am eager to learn new skills and contribute my skills and knowledge to exciting projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the tech community to solve complex problems in the digital age especially here in Africa.

        <h1>"MY JOURNEY"</h1>

        

        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p>
            Everyone has a story to tell about how they found themselves in the field they’re in today. Often, people say they chose their paths because of passion. I guess my story is a little different.

It was never my dream to become a tech person. Although I loved technology and knew how to use a computer as a young Ghanaian kid, my real passion was for health and food. All I dreamed of was becoming a doctor or a chef, because I was (and still am) a good cook.

Then came something I didn’t expect — fear. I doubted myself, thinking I wasn’t good enough and afraid that I would fail. I wasn’t ready to face failure. I thought becoming a pilot would be easier, so I decided to take that path instead. From as early as my second year in basic school, I dreamed of flying planes, yet I never stopped learning small things about food, health, and how they work together to heal the body.

Before I entered high school, my mother encouraged me to study Biology, one of the subjects I thought was impossible. I told her I wouldn’t do it — not because I didn’t respect her advice, but because I was afraid. Later, I spoke to an alumna about my pilot dream, and she suggested I take ICT as an elective in high school. She said it would help me transition into engineering after school, leading me to become a pilot.

So I did. Three years in ICT class often felt like I was in the wrong place — but at least, it wasn’t as demanding as Biology. I completed high school without taking my programming classes seriously, because I believed I was only there to avoid Biology and would later pursue health studies at the university.

But life had other plans. When I applied for university, I was denied admission into the health program. The only available option left for me was Computer Science. I felt lost — I didn’t know where to start or how to move forward.

Things began to change during my first internship. A fellow intern shared his journey into tech and how he began from zero. His story motivated me to start small, to take my first step — and that’s exactly what I did.

That’s how I truly landed in tech. This 90-day challenge is part of that journey — to build myself, grow my skills, and become excellent in what I do. I aim to become a data scientist, but I also want to gain strong foundations in web development, software engineering, and cybersecurity.

I believe I can do it — not because I feel completely ready (I’m not), but because I hold on to God’s promise:

“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” — Philippians 4:13

I believe He will guide me through this journey, and one day, I’ll become a tech guru who inspires others — especially those who, like me, once felt lost and afraid — to keep pressing on with faith and determination.

    <h2>MY INTEREST AND AREAS I WANT TO GROW </h2>
    <p>
    These are the areas I am deeply passionate about and want to grow in as I continue
    my journey in tech and personal development.
  </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Faith in Christ</h2>
            <p>
                My faith is the foundation of my life. I strive to grow spiritually and live according to Christian values,
                seeking to inspire and uplift others through my actions and words. Just as the word of God says in 2 Timothy 3:16-17.
                Moses strived to be the best he could be because God was with him. I want to be the best version of myself because God is with me.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>
                Everybody wants to solve problems in the world, which is a great ambition. But if we don’t have the right data and information, 
                we risk solving the wrong problems. That’s why I want to learn and grow in data science — to study data carefully, 
                identify gaps and loopholes, and figure out the best ways to address these challenges effectively.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                Just as gold is refined in a crucible, I see this side of technology — websites and web development — as a powerful way to refine and showcase ideas.
                In a world where everyone wants to be known and seen, I believe building webpages can help me advertise myself while also assisting others who want their voices heard. 
                It makes finding, connecting, and interacting with people ,<b>easier</b>, <b>faster</b>, <b>more convenient</b>, and <b>more affordable</b>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
           <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
              <p>
                 In today’s digital age, where everything is connected online, cybersecurity has become a critical concern. 
                 I want to grow in this area to help protect individuals and organizations from cyber threats, ensuring their data and systems remain secure.
                 By understanding the latest security measures and best practices, I aim to contribute to creating a safer online environment for everyone.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                Software engineering is the backbone of modern technology, and I want to grow in this field to develop efficient and reliable software solutions.
                By mastering programming languages, software development methodologies, and best practices, I aim to create applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h2>AI Development</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries and shaping the future of technology. 
                I want to grow in AI development to harness its potential for creating intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions.
                By exploring machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing, I aim to contribute to advancements in AI that can benefit society in various ways.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Personal Development</h2>
            <p>
                Personal development is a lifelong journey of growth and self-improvement. 
                I want to focus on enhancing my skills, mindset, and overall well-being to become the best version of myself.
                By setting goals, seeking feedback, and embracing challenges, I aim to cultivate resilience, adaptability, and a growth mindset that will empower me to navigate life’s ups and downs with confidence and grace.
